Power-On
========

Pengwyn takes the power from the mini-USB connector *CN6* and/or connector **CN1**. The board is
not shipped with an external power adapter.

On connector *CN6* you can also have the serial console, so, during your daily development use,
you would just connect your workstation to the board using a mini-USB to connector *CN6*. If you
connect some power hungry device to the board, you can give more power to the board by connecting
the power adapter.
