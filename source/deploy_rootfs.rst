To deploy the root file system and the boot partition, first you need a SD card correctly formatted.

.. include:: sdcard.rst

Make sure everything has been really written to the SD card:

.. raw:: html

 <div>
 <div><b class="admonition-host">&nbsp;&nbsp;Host&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a style="float: right;" href="javascript:select_text( 'deploy_rootfs_rst-host-131' );">select</a></div>
 <pre class="line-numbers pre-replacer" data-start="1"><code id="deploy_rootfs_rst-host-131" class="language-markup">sync</code></pre>
 <script src="_static/prism.js"></script>
 <script src="_static/select_text.js"></script>
 </div>

Then unmount the SD card from your computer and plug the SD in the board socket.
