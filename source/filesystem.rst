Filesystem
----------
The operating system will use the filesystem in the directory:

/home/pengwyn/ti-sdk-am335x-evm-05.06.00.00/targetNFS

.. image:: /_static/filesystem1.png
 
Copy to this folder all the files you want in the distribution. In this tutorial we are not going to do any modification to the filesystem. 

The only change that was made was adding the logo showed during the startup of the board.
